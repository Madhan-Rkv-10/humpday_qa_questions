--  
And the second question is what would be the best way of implementing the terminal view? - Mesota  
Mesota

Mesota

Mesota  
clear you don't really clear the terminal but clear the History List. I think if I could use some kind of native view that would make a lot of things easier.  
  
Mesota  
But I also don‚Äôt know if there are native views for macOS and Linux. I only know one for Windows.
